This is aided by the fact that neither of the regular panellists is constrained by party politics, as former panellist Diane Abbott was noted for rebelling against the former Labour government and Portillo has left the House of Commons.

David Doyle co-starred as a sidekick to the three women and John Forsythe played the voice of their boss.

The following September, America's Most Wanted's host, John Walsh, announced that the program would resume on the cable network Lifetime later that year.\n\nPresented by Walsh, the show's purpose is to profile and assist law enforcement in the apprehension of fugitives wanted for numerous crimes, including murder, rape, kidnapping, child molestation, white-collar crime, organized crime, armed robbery, gang violence, and terrorism, and also many of whom are currently on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. On May 2, 2008, the program's website announced its 1,000th capture; as of March 30, 2013, 1,202 people have been captured because of AMW.

The system has been duplicated by most of the show's successors in the judicial genre. Moreover, The People's Court is the first popular, long-running reality in the judicial genre. It was preceded only by a few short-lived realities in the genre; these short-lived predecessors were only loosely related to judicial proceedings, except for one: Parole took footage from real-life courtrooms holding legal proceedings. Prior to The People's Court, the vast majority of TV courtroom shows used actors, and recreated or fictional cases. Among examples of these types of court shows include Famous Jury Trials and Your Witness.\n\nThe People's Court has had two contrasting lives. The show's first life was presided over solely by former Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Joseph Wapner. His tenure lasted from the show's debut on September 14, 1981, until May 21, 1993, when the show was cancelled due to low ratings. This left the show with a total of 2,484 \u00bd-hour episodes and 12 seasons. The show was taped in Los Angeles during its first life.

Returning from the telefilms would be Lee Majors, Richard Anderson and Alan Oppenheimer, whose Rudy Wells would be reduced to a single guest appearance for Season One. Replacing Glen A. Larson as Exec. Producer would be showrunner Harve Bennett, while producer Michael Gleason would be replaced by the producing team of Sam Strangis and Donald R. Boyle.

Recurring characters introduced include Dr. Dolenz, Irina Leonova, the Hopper twins, and Helen Elgin, Steve\u2019s mom. Another recurring character introduced was astronaut Major Kelly Woods, played by Majors' wife and soon-to-be-superstar Farrah Fawcett-Majors, who would not only return in the fourth season to reprise the role of Kelly, but in the interim guest star in seasons 2 and 3 playing different characters.\n\nSeason One would establish the now-legendary show intro, standardize on the slow-motion presentation of bionics, the effects used for Steve\u2019s eye, and introduce many of the sounds later used for Steve\u2019s bionic strength. It also introduced lifelike androids as adversaries, which would become a staple for both The Six Million Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman.\n\nSteve's character would return to the more sensitive character audiences recalled from the first telefilm, after a detour into James Bond emulation for the Suspense Movies. Oscar Goldman would also lose some of his manipulative aspects and gain some warmth for his pal Steve.", "poster_path": "/2aSFxG8Pcd6xrMbjFIKzCdfM8qV.jpg", "season_number": 1}, {"air_date": "1974-09-13", "episode_count": 22, "id": 61151, "name": "Season 2", "overview": "The first full-length season of The Six Million Dollar Man ran for 22 episodes during the Fall of 1974 - Spring of 1975. In this season the sounds used for bionics would be standardized and the main title sequence would see its biggest revision, bringing it to its most familiar form.\n\nA good twenty seconds longer, the new intro struck a different tone from its predecessor. Notably, Oscar now addresses his audience as \"Gentlemen,\" the famous \"wireframe\" graphics are first seen, Oliver Nelson's score dominates the final stretch, and the final freeze frame used for the show title is more centered and better illuminated, and would become the standard title for the show from then on (a vestige of the original is seen in the end titles, superimposed over the Season One freeze frame for all five seasons). For some reason one Season 2 episode, \"Pilot Error\" was produced using the Season 1 version of the credits, except with slight alterations to the sound mix and a different musical flourish at the end.\n\nReplacing producers Sam Strangis and Donald R. Boyle would be Lionel E. Siegel and Joe L. Cramer.\n\nRecurring characters introduced would be Barney Hiller, Kuroda, Audrey Moss, Oscar's secretary Peggy Callahan, Steve's stepdad Jim Elgin and, most importantly, Jaime Sommers.\n\nExpanding upon the success of \"The Coward\" and \"Burning Bright\", a number of episodes focused more on characters than bionics or spy plots. Standouts include \"Straight On 'Til Morning\", in which Steve comes to the aid of a family of alien explorers; \"The Deadly Replay\", in which the emotional aftermath of Austin's original crash is explored; \"The Seven Million Dollar Man\", which showed how poorly Austin's transformation could have gone; and, of course, the show's landmark two-parter, \"The Bionic Woman\".\n\nJaime's apparent death in that storyline sparked a fan outcry, and combined with high ratings and favorable press this led to a return for Lindsay Wagner to the role in the following year, bringing many changes. The two-part storyline that introduced the Bionic Woman (before killing her off) was intended to be the season finale, but perhaps not wanting to end the season on a down note, it was broadcast earlier, with two standalone episodes ending the season.\n\nIt was during Season 2 that it became clear that The Six Million Dollar Man was becoming an idol for many children. Perhaps due to this, certain violent elements common during the first season were toned down. After a one-off event in \"Nuclear Alert\", Austin would rarely be shown intentionally killing anyone, for example. However, Jaime notwithstanding, his newfound fame as a kids' hero doesn't stop Austin from adding many names to his roster of girlfriends, causing Oscar at one point (in \"Act of Piracy\") to moan, \"Why don't I hate him?\"", "poster_path": "/zg6XQvUv1UJNvRQqMVphFIbPV9G.jpg", "season_number": 2}, {"air_date": "1975-09-14", "episode_count": 21, "id": 61152, "name": "Season 3", "overview": "The third season of The Six Million Dollar Man was a period of major change for the show, running for 21 episodes from the Fall of 1975 to the Spring of 1976.\n\nJaime Sommers would return and gain her own series, while Martin E. Brooks would replace Alan Oppenheimer (who would nevertheless reprise the role one last time this season) as Dr. Rudy Wells and what may be the series\u2019 most famous episode would air, The Secret of Bigfoot.\n\nA slight alteration to the mix would be the only change to the show intro, while Steve's bionic sounds would add a few new ones for jumping. Both Lee Majors and Lindsay Wagner would appear on one another's shows six times after her appearance in the premiere (for a complete list of joint appearances, refer to the Crossovers article).\n\nTragedy would strike the show in late October 1975 as series composer Oliver Nelson passed away suddenly of a heart attack. The show continued to use music composed by Nelson throughout the Season, but as time wore on, new material was exhausted. Reuse, or \"tracking\" of Nelson's Season 3 work was done for some remaining episodes. After several new composers were hired later in the Season, beginning with \"The White Lightning War,\" the show would settle on J. J. Johnson the following Season, but Nelson's theme and musical legacy would continue to guide the show's music for the remainder of its run.\n\nReplacing producers Lionel E. Siegel and Joe L.

The Cowboys began as an hour-long series, but ABC decided to reduce running time to a half hour format.\n\nThe format change did not lead to increased viewers, and the show was the victim of early cancellation.\n\nGuest stars included Cal Bellini as Wa-Cha-Ka in \"The Indian Givers\", Kevin Hagen as Josh Redding in \"Death on a Fast Horse\", and Lurene Tuttle as Grandma Jesse in \"Many a Good Horse Died\".", "popularity": 1.617, "poster_path": null, "production_companies": [], "seasons": [{"air_date": "1974-02-06", "episode_count": 10, "id": 25997, "name": "Season 1", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 1}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Scripted", "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0}, "The Guns of Will Sonnett": {"backdrop_path": "/8OuOjRADQgnII7D3SNKrIY0HZBe.jpg", "created_by": [{"id": 28715, "credit_id": "52582c98760ee36aaa897302", "name": "Aaron Spelling", "gender": 2, "profile_path": "/hJzm2yHN1enUy7Ag588TeCrXHR9.jpg"}], "episode_run_time": [30], "first_air_date": "1967-09-08", "genres": [{"id": 37, "name": "Western"}], "homepage": "", "id": 13912, "in_production": false, "languages": ["en"], "last_air_date": "1969-09-16", "last_episode_to_air": {"air_date": "1969-09-16", "episode_number": 1, "id": 509302, "name": "Three Stand Together", "overview": "After two long years of searching, Will and Jeff finally catch up to Jim Sonnett.

Each season covers many aspects of building a house, including laying the foundation, weather delays, tackling restrictive terrain, dealing with permits, putting on the finishing touches, budgetary issues, and arguments between the homeowners and contractors.", "popularity": 0.902, "poster_path": null, "production_companies": [], "seasons": [{"air_date": null, "episode_count": 13, "id": 24710, "name": "Season 1", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 1}, {"air_date": null, "episode_count": 13, "id": 24711, "name": "Season 2", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 2}, {"air_date": "2003-03-31", "episode_count": 13, "id": 24712, "name": "Season 3", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 3}, {"air_date": "1999-03-29", "episode_count": 13, "id": 24713, "name": "Season 4", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 4}, {"air_date": null, "episode_count": 13, "id": 24714, "name": "Season 5", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 5}, {"air_date": null, "episode_count": 13, "id": 24715, "name": "Season 6", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 6}, {"air_date": "2000-10-05", "episode_count": 13, "id": 24716, "name": "Season 7", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 7}, {"air_date": "2001-10-08", "episode_count": 13, "id": 24717, "name": "Season 8", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 8}, {"air_date": "2002-10-01", "episode_count": 13, "id": 24718, "name": "Season 9", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 9}, {"air_date": "2003-09-29", "episode_count": 13, "id": 24719, "name": "Season 10", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 10}, {"air_date": null, "episode_count": 13, "id": 24720, "name": "Season 11", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 11}, {"air_date": null, "episode_count": 13, "id": 24721, "name": "Season 12", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 12}, {"air_date": "2005-10-03", "episode_count": 13, "id": 24722, "name": "Season 14", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 14}, {"air_date": "2006-11-05", "episode_count": 10, "id": 24723, "name": "Season 15", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 15}, {"air_date": null, "episode_count": 8, "id": 24724, "name": "Season 16", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 16}, {"air_date": "2007-09-23", "episode_count": 8, "id": 24725, "name": "Season 17", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 17}, {"air_date": null, "episode_count": 8, "id": 24726, "name": "Season 18", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 18}, {"air_date": null, "episode_count": 8, "id": 24727, "name": "Season 19", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 19}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Scripted", "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0}, "Duel": {"backdrop_path": "/c6RbSxextrzqnisOJaaCcPd91VJ.jpg", "created_by": [{"id": 1845310, "credit_id": "595d01b392514121f0056cef", "name": "Shigenobu Matsumoto", "gender": 0, "profile_path": null}], "episode_run_time": [24, 30], "first_air_date": "2002-10-21", "genres": [{"id": 10759, "name": "Action & Adventure"}, {"id": 16, "name": "Animation"}, {"id": 35, "name": "Comedy"}], "homepage": "http://dm.takaratomy.co.jp/", "id": 46392, "in_production": false, "languages": ["ja"], "last_air_date": "2015-06-28", "last_episode_to_air": {"air_date": "2015-06-28", "episode_number": 13, "id": 1335296, "name": "giko giko giko??!! matarou ga deta!!!", "overview": "", "production_code": null, "season_number": 11, "show_id": 46392, "still_path": null, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0}, "name": "Duel Masters", "next_episode_to_air": null, "networks": [{"name": "Cartoon Network", "id": 56, "logo_path": "/c5OC6oVCg6QP4eqzW6XIq17CQjI.png", "origin_country": "US"}, {"name": "Kids Station", "id": 610, "logo_path": "/7V7vR2yOXblLOZH0qa1Zcqs5BRs.png", "origin_country": "JP"}], "number_of_episodes": 376, "number_of_seasons": 11, "origin_country": ["JP"], "original_language": "ja", "original_name": "\u30c7\u30e5\u30a8\u30eb\u30fb\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba", "overview": "A mysterious organization is interested in fledging duelist Shobu Kirifuda's ability to bring Duel Master creatures to life.

The show was based on Whitney Blake's own life as a single mother, raising her child, future actress Meredith Baxter. The show was developed by Norman Lear and was produced by T.A.T. Communications Company, Allwhit, Inc., and later Embassy Television.\n\nLike many shows developed by Lear, One Day at a Time was more of a comedy-drama, using its half-hour to tackle serious issues in life and relationships, particularly those related to second wave feminism. The earlier seasons in particular featured several multi-part episodes, serious topics, and dramatic moments. As in other Lear shows of the era, the show was shot on videotape in front of a live audience, giving it a sense of immediacy, and close-ups were often employed during dramatic scenes. As the social climate changed in the 1980s, the show's writing became less edgy, and as the girls became adults, the innovation of the original premise \u2014 a divorced mother raising teenage children \u2014 was lost.

The show is hosted by former model, carpenter and veteran television personality Ty Pennington.\n\nEach episode features a family that has faced some sort of recent or ongoing hardship such as a natural disaster or a family member with a life-threatening illness, in need of new hope. The show's producers coordinate with a local construction contractor, which then coordinates with various companies in the building trades for a makeover of the family's home. This includes interior, exterior and landscaping, performed in seven days while the family is on vacation and documented in the episode. If the house is beyond repair, they replace it entirely. The show's producers and crew film set and perform the makeover but do not pay for it. The materials and labor are donated. Many skilled and unskilled volunteers assist in the rapid construction of the house.\n\nEM:HE is considered a spinoff of Extreme Makeover, an earlier series providing personal makeovers to selected individuals, which the Home Edition has now outlasted. This show displays extreme changes to help recreate someone's space. However, the format differs considerably; in the original Extreme Makeover, for instance, participants were not necessarily chosen based on any recent hardship, whereas the family's backstory is an important component of Home Edition.

Three of the bouts were dark matches, but the final four matches were televised. The event drew 10,000 fans to the Omni, while the broadcast had a Nielsen rating of 3.2. One of the televised matches ended in a disqualification when Baron Von Raschke and Krusher Khruschev interfered on behalf of Ivan and Nikita Koloff to attack the Road Warriors.\n\nThree National Wrestling Alliance titles were defended at the event. Dusty Rhodes successfully defended his NWA National Heavyweight Championship against Tully Blanchard when the match ended in a time limit draw. After the match, he argued with Blanchard's manager, J.J. Dillon, which allowed Blanchard to attack him from behind. Despite not winning the title belt officially, Blanchard took it with him as he left the ring. Ric Flair defeated Ron Garvin to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship when the referee did not notice that Garvin's foot was on the bottom rope, which should have invalidated the pinfall. The NWA World Tag Team Championship changed hands as Bobby Eaton of the The Midnight Express pinned Ricky Morton of The Rock 'n' Roll Express to win the title.

The series premiered on NBC on September 14, 1985, and aired there for four seasons. The series moved to ABC for one season from 1989 to 1990, and concluded on September 6, 1991 as part of the Disney Afternoon television syndication package. Of the series' 65 shows, 30 were double-features, consisting of two 11-minute cartoons, thereby bringing the series total to 94 distinct episodes overall. The show is well-remembered for its theme music, written by Michael and Patty Silversher and creation of \"gummiberry juice\" which was a topic of magic potion, gaining abilities to defend them against the foes.\n\nThe series was later rebroadcast on the syndicated Disney Afternoon block, and rerun on the Disney Afternoon through the summer of 1991.

When it was Time For Beany, the entire family was crowded around the 6\" television screen. The crux of Beany's success was the intermingling of current political issues and fiascos that appeared as thinly veiled plots easily recognizable as lampoons of current political issues or personalities. The Shakespearian asides given by Beany, Cecil and the rest of the cast were magnificent and often alluded to embarrassing public fiascos or personages, on which the adult audience immediately picked up.

Supporting segments include Dudley Do-Right, Peabody's Improbable History, and Fractured Fairy Tales, among others.\n\nRocky & Bullwinkle is known for quality writing and wry humor. Mixing puns, cultural and topical satire, and self-referential humor, it appealed to adults as well as children. It was also one of the first cartoons whose animation was outsourced; storyboards were shipped to Gamma Productions, a Mexican studio also employed by Total Television.

Created by brothers Lawrence and Charles Gordon, it was considered a modernized version of the classic 1960s sitcom I Dream of Jeannie. The series stars Richard Gilliland as a mild-mannered TV weatherman for KPOX-TV, and T. K. Carter as a hip, fun-loving 3,000-year-old genie who is freed by Gilliland after being imprisoned in his bottle for nearly two centuries.\n\nThe series was produced by Lorimar Productions, and initially promoted by ABC as one of its new ambitious comedies along with Webster. Just Our Luck was created to compete against The A-Team on NBC but earned low ratings for much of its run. It was poorly received by critics, however, and was the subject of controversy when the NAACP charged the show with promoting negative stereotypes of African-Americans. The NAACP originally campaigned to have the show removed but later settled for a degree of creative control in the show's development. This included changes to Carter's dialogue, the hiring of black staff writers and the addition of Leonard Simon to the cast. The show was cancelled after three months.", "popularity": 1.09, "poster_path": null, "production_companies": [], "seasons": [{"air_date": "1983-09-20", "episode_count": 13, "id": 44418, "name": "Season 1", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 1}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Scripted", "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0}, "Just the Ten of Us": {"backdrop_path": null, "created_by": [{"id": 1212511, "credit_id": "525725f8760ee3776a261d3c", "name": "Steve Marshall", "profile_path": null}], "episode_run_time": [30], "first_air_date": "1988-04-26", "genres": [{"id": 35, "name": "Comedy"}], "homepage": "", "id": 2174, "in_production": false, "languages": ["en"], "last_air_date": "1990-05-03", "last_episode_to_air": {"air_date": "1990-05-03", "episode_number": 23, "id": 152819, "name": "Slaughter House Ten", "overview": "Graham and J.R. go to the store for groceries and come back with a cow.

Annie was Slap's ex-wife, who nonetheless retained a soft spot for him.\n\nA recurring event throughout the series' run is that at some point in each episode, someone would hit Slap, with a nun even doing the honors in one episode.\n\nThe show was created by Jay Tarses, who in 1983 was co-creator of Buffalo Bill, an NBC sitcom in which Coleman starred as a similarly off-putting character, the host of a TV talk show.", "popularity": 1.254, "poster_path": "/4vLHcrW1gX793hDPEKCZU4yV4GH.jpg", "production_companies": [], "seasons": [{"air_date": "1987-09-23", "episode_count": 22, "id": 19872, "name": "Season 1", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 1}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Scripted", "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 1}, "The Smith Family": {"backdrop_path": null, "created_by": [{"id": 85841, "credit_id": "52586e60760ee346611f428b", "name": "Edmund L.

Created by Agnes Nixon, All My Children is set in Pine Valley, Pennsylvania, a fictitious suburb of Philadelphia which is modeled on the actual Philadelphia suburb of Rosemont. The original series featured Susan Lucci as Erica Kane, one of daytime's most popular characters. The title of the series refers to the bonds of humanity. All My Children was the first new network daytime drama to debut in the 1970s. Originally owned by Creative Horizons, Inc., the company created by Nixon and her husband, Bob, the show was sold to ABC in January 1975. The series started at a half-hour in per-installment length, then was expanded to a full hour on April 25, 1977. Earlier, the show had experimented with the full-hour format for one week starting on June 30, 1975, after which Ryan's Hope premiered.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1990, All My Children was recorded at ABC's TV18 at 101 West 67th St, now a 50-story apartment tower. From March 1990 to December 2009, it was taped at ABC's television studio TV23 at 320 West 66th Street in Manhattan, New York City, New York. In December 2009, the locale for taping the series moved from the costly New York City to California. The show was then produced in Stages 1 and 2 at the Andrita Studios in Los Angeles, California, and is now produced at the Connecticut Film Center in Stamford, Connecticut.

The show was created by Dan Curtis. The story bible, which was written by Art Wallace, does not mention any supernatural elements. It was unprecedented in daytime television when ghosts were introduced about six months after it began.\n\nThe series became hugely popular when vampire Barnabas Collins appeared a year into its run. Dark Shadows also featured werewolves, zombies, man-made monsters, witches, warlocks, time travel, and a parallel universe. A small company of actors each played many roles; indeed, as actors came and went, some characters were played by more than one actor. Major writers besides Art Wallace included Malcolm Marmorstein, Sam Hall, Gordon Russell, and Violet Welles.\n\nDark Shadows was distinguished by its vividly melodramatic performances, atmospheric interiors, memorable storylines, numerous dramatic plot twists, unusually adventurous music score, and broad and epic cosmos of characters and heroic adventures. Now regarded as something of a classic, it continues to enjoy an intense cult following. Although the original series ran for only five years, its scheduling as a daily daytime drama allowed it to amass more single episodes during its run than most other science-fiction/fantasy genre series produced for English-language television, including Doctor Who and the entire Star Trek television franchise.

The new show featured longtime General Hospital characters Lucy Coe, Kevin Collins, Scott Baldwin, and Karen Wexler, along with several new characters, most of whom were interns in a competitive medical school program. In the first episode, tenured nurse Audrey Hardy was injured and an intern had to operate on her with a power drill to save her life.\n\nIn the first few years, Port Charles got a reputation for focusing most of its energies on the medical school program, setting more of its main action at Port Charles' General Hospital than was seen on the parent show, General Hospital. As it evolved, it turned its focus to stories with gothic intrigue that included themes such as forbidden love, vampires, and life after death. It also abandoned the basic open-ended writing style used on all other daytime dramas in December 2000, instead creating thirteen-week story arcs. This type of storytelling is a staple of Latin telenovelas. It also allowed the cast, crew, and writing staff to only work six months out of the year.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": null, "production_companies": [], "seasons": [{"air_date": "1997-06-01", "episode_count": 152, "id": 458, "name": "Season 1", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 1}, {"air_date": "1998-01-02", "episode_count": 196, "id": 454, "name": "Season 2", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 2}, {"air_date": "1999-01-06", "episode_count": 41, "id": 457, "name": "Season 3", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 3}, {"air_date": "2000-01-05", "episode_count": 54, "id": 455, "name": "Season 4", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 4}, {"air_date": "2000-12-04", "episode_count": 13, "id": 456, "name": "Season 5", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 5}, {"air_date": "2001-03-05", "episode_count": 24, "id": 460, "name": "Season 6", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 6}, {"air_date": "2001-06-04", "episode_count": 65, "id": 459, "name": "Season 7", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 7}, {"air_date": "2001-09-03", "episode_count": 59, "id": 462, "name": "Season 8", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 8}, {"air_date": "2001-12-03", "episode_count": 20, "id": 461, "name": "Season 9", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 9}, {"air_date": "2002-01-02", "episode_count": 63, "id": 466, "name": "Season 10", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 10}, {"air_date": "2002-04-01", "episode_count": 65, "id": 464, "name": "Season 11", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 11}, {"air_date": "2002-07-01", "episode_count": 64, "id": 469, "name": "Season 12", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 12}, {"air_date": "2002-09-30", "episode_count": 64, "id": 465, "name": "Season 13", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 13}, {"air_date": "2002-12-30", "episode_count": 64, "id": 468, "name": "Season 14", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 14}, {"air_date": "2003-04-02", "episode_count": 69, "id": 467, "name": "Season 15", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 15}, {"air_date": "2003-07-07", "episode_count": 65, "id": 463, "name": "Season 16", "overview": "", "poster_path": null, "season_number": 16}], "status": "Ended", "type": "Scripted", "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0}, "Ryan's Hope": {"backdrop_path": null, "created_by": [{"id": 213970, "credit_id": "57fb66fc92514144ac007aff", "name": "Claire Labine", "profile_path": null}, {"id": 1217700, "credit_id": "52537fdc19c29579401c30d1", "name": "Paul Avila Mayer", "profile_path": null}], "episode_run_time": [30], "first_air_date": "1975-07-07", "genres": [{"id": 18, "name": "Drama"}], "homepage": "", "id": 515, "in_production": false, "languages": ["en"], "last_air_date": "1981-11-16", "last_episode_to_air": {"air_date": "1981-11-16", "episode_number": 1656, "id": 1460617, "name": "RH-1656", "overview": "", "production_code": null, "season_number": 1, "show_id": 515, "still_path": null, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0}, "name": "Ryan's Hope", "next_episode_to_air": null, "networks": [{"name": "ABC", "id": 2, "logo_path": "/uuEOGcTrJ9xq8WSI2OGvGFpp9H.png", "origin_country": "US"}], "number_of_episodes": 2, "number_of_seasons": 1, "origin_country": ["US"], "original_language": "en", "original_name": "Ryan's Hope", "overview": "Ryan's Hope is an American soap opera created by Claire Labine and Paul Avila Mayer, originally airing for 13 years on ABC from July 7, 1975 to January 13, 1989.

Additionally, The Baseball Network had exclusive coverage windows; no other broadcaster could televise MLB games during the same night that The Baseball Network was televising games.\n\nThe arrangement did not last long; due to the effects of a players' strike on the remainder of the 1994 season, and poor reception from fans and critics over the coverage was implemented, The Baseball Network would be disbanded after the 1995 season.

It was carried by the ABC network and aired each weekday afternoon. Created by Dick Clark as a spin-off of American Bandstand, Where the Action Is premiered on June 27, 1965.\n\nOriginally intended as a summer replacement and broadcast at 2 P.M. EDT, the show was successful enough for it to continue throughout the 1965-66 TV season, with a change in time period to 4:30 P.M. Eastern time, so its young audience could continue to watch it once schools opened in September.\n\nThe show's theme song, \"Action\", became a hit single for Freddy \"Boom Boom\" Cannon, peaking on the charts in September 1965. Most of the telecasts, all of which were produced in black-and-white, were taped at various locales in Southern California although a handful of segments were taped elsewhere in the country. The theme song was written by Steve Venet and Tommy Boyce. Later Boyce co-write songs for The Monkees.\n\nThe program had its own stable of performers, most notably Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders, who served as the de facto house band. When the group departed the show in 1966, they were replaced by The Robbs. Other regular performers on Action included the dance troupe Pete Manifee and the Action Kids. Individual episodes featured a wide range of guest performers, as detailed below.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": null, "production_companies": [], "seasons": [], "status": "Ended", "type": "Scripted", "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0}, "Whose Line Is It Anyway?": {"backdrop_path": "/hdUpWLIDg4JxBM9L3D9RiX8rRem.jpg", "created_by": [], "episode_run_time": [22], "first_air_date": "1998-08-05", "genres": [{"id": 35, "name": "Comedy"}], "homepage": "http://www.cwtv.com/shows/whose-line-is-it-anyway", "id": 61018, "in_production": true, "languages": ["en"], "last_air_date": "2018-08-13", "last_episode_to_air": {"air_date": "2018-08-13", "episode_number": 12, "id": 1548536, "name": "Carmen Electra", "overview": "Carmen Electra guests on the improvisational-comedy showcase in which the performers wing it unscripted and unrehearsed.", "production_code": null, "season_number": 14, "show_id": 61018, "still_path": null, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0}, "name": "Whose Line Is It Anyway?", "next_episode_to_air": null, "networks": [{"name": "The CW", "id": 71, "logo_path": "/ge9hzeaU7nMtQ4PjkFlc68dGAJ9.png", "origin_country": "US"}], "number_of_episodes": 312, "number_of_seasons": 14, "origin_country": ["US"], "original_language": "en", "original_name": "Whose Line Is It Anyway?", "overview": "\"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\" (1998-2007, 2013-) is the US edition of the British show of the same name (with many of the same performers).
