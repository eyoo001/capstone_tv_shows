It has deep forests and vast mountain ranges, and a third of it sits above the Arctic Circle. The whole state goes through some of the most extreme seasonal changes: temperatures can reach into the 90s F (30s C) in the summer and can plummet to -80F (-60C) in the winter.\r\n\r\nYet plenty survives here - Alaska is home to some of the hardiest animals on the planet. Each one has its own quirky way of getting through the challenges of the seasons. Above all, this is a land of great characters.\r\n\r\nBlack bear cubs are faced with a daunting climb down from their tree den and a mother sea otter nurses her baby through the chilly days of early spring. Stealthy 50-tonne sperm whales steal fish from the end of fishermen's lines in an extraordinary marine 'heist', grizzly bears grow big on a sudden wealth of salmon, and a huge male moose finds unlikely ways to impress a female. Thousands of bald eagles gather for a winter feast, and arctic foxes risk everything to find food in the alien world of an oil boomtown.

Scholars begged God for light to enable them to pursue their studies. In fact, the 'Dark Ages' between 800 and 1500 were a brilliant, dynamic time that paved the way for many achievements of our modern day world. This four part documentary series throws light on an epoch of major importance. Experimental historical research illustrates the impact the Middle Ages had on the Modern Age. It tells of the scientific, technical and cultural achievements of the Middle Ages which paved the way for modernity and continue to influence western society to the present day. We follow four protagonists on their journeys throughout Europe, reviving the medieval world of knights, monks, peasants and burghers. The series clears up misconceptions, solves puzzles and also investigates both mundane and technical questions: What did the first mechanical clock, or the first globe, look like, for example? With what force did a lance in full flight strike a suit of armour? And why did the invention of the horse halter and the giro account represent a veritable cultural revolution?

His wide-ranging thesis has been brought to the world's attention through the A Test of Time series of books and the internationally acclaimed TV documentary series 'Pharaohs and Kings - A Biblical Quest'.\r\n\r\nAs an archaeologist and historian, David has been primarily interested in what he perceives to be flaws in the accepted timeline of the Ancient World. His rediscovery of the historical Bible was an unexpected by-product of his Egyptological research.\r\n\r\nMany scholars have been teaching that the Bible is little more than myth. But, in all fairness, until recently most of the biblical story was not supported by archaeological or textual evidence. David Rohl addresses these issues and, through his New Chronology timeline, is able to produce exciting and surprising historical settings for some of our favorite Biblical characters - such as Saul, David, Solomon, Joshua, Moses, and Joseph.\r\n\r\nDavid Rohl's first television documentary series originally aired in 1995 and, in 2004, David flew to Florida to present a public workshop: 'The Bible - Myth or Reality?' for the very first time in the USA. This workshop featured over 200 of David's personal slides and is available in a DVD-set, which goes hand-in-hand with the A Test of Time book and original 'Pharaohs and Kings' television special. And now, here, 'Pharaohs and Kings' is finally available on DVD. \r\n\r\nThe long-lost historical world of the Old Testament is revealed for the first time through David Rohl's New Chronology - the most exciting development in biblical research for generations.

Along the way they make humourous observations about the people they meet and the places they visit.

Doug is an independent lawyer, and Kate was a housewife (she would eventually go back to school herself). They had three children: Nancy (portrayed by Elayne Heilveil in the original mini-series and later by Meredith Baxter Birney), Willie (Gary Frank), and Letitia, nicknamed \"Buddy\" (Kristy McNichol). (There was another son, Timothy, who had died five years previous to the series' beginning.) The show raised the profile of all of its featured actors during its run and, in particular, catapulted McNichol to stardom.\r\nThe show attempted to depict the \"average\" family, warts and all. Storylines were very topical, and the show was one of the first to feature shows that have recently been termed as \"very special episodes.\" In the first episode, Nancy walked in on her husband Jeff (John Rubinstein) making love to one of her friends. During the second season she and Jeff divorced, but Jeff would continue to appear regularly as an active father, as well as finding himself involved in more of the Lawrence family's affairs. Other topical storylines included Kate having to deal with the possibility that she had breast cancer, as well as Buddy dealing with advances from boys. In the later seasons, there were instances in which Buddy had to decide whether or not to have sex; she always chose to wait, most notably in an episode with guest star Leif Garrett, who was a teen idol at the time. Another topical episode dealt with Buddy's friendship with a teacher who was revealed to be a lesbian. Family also dealt with alcoholism (Doug's sister; Buddy's old friend) as well as adoption, when the family adopted a girl named Annie Cooper (Quinn Cummings).

Eduardo is the son of Soledad, their housekeeper. The two children were raised together and, in spite of their class differences, are joined by a love that is pure and innocent.\r\n\r\nGonzalo leads a full, happy life with his wife Monserrat and their 5 children, unaware of the danger that is closing in on them. Artemio Bravo hates Gonzalo with a passion and his only goal in life is to destroy the entire Elizalde family, slowly and painfully. The first pawn in his perverse game is Rebeca Sanchez, an unscrupulous young woman who secures a position in Gonzalo\u2019s company under an assumed name, Barbara Greco. Her efficiency and sharp mind catch Gonzalo\u2019s attention and he appoints her as his personal assistant. Gradually, and with great cunning, Barbara gains his full trust.\r\n\r\nBarbara\u2019s initial targets are Fernanda and Eduardo. Having surprised them in an innocent kiss, she persuades Monserrat with a subtle touch of poison that the boy is a danger to her precious daughter and should be sent away to a boarding school. The children\u2019s letters are intercepted by Soledad, who has made the painful decision of stopping them from reaching their destination and, eventually, Fernanda feels that Eduardo has forgotten her.\r\n\r\nThe next move in Artemio\u2019s gambit is to crown Barbara as Gonzalo\u2019s queen, and this means that Monserrat must die. Barbara smothers her with a pillow and frames the eldest daughter Liliana for the murder. Protesting her innocence, the desperate teenager is locked away in a psychiatric hospital. Later, Gonzalo weds Barbara and gives her a seat on the board of directors of his company.\r\n\r\nSoledad is the only one who has realized the full scope of Barbara\u2019s evil nature, but she is forced to hold her tongue. For years she lives in quiet dread, missing her son Eduardo and terrified that one day Barbara will carry out her threat of having him killed. Time goes by and Eduardo returns after obtaining his master\u2019s degree abroad, only to find his mother gravely ill. She tells him of the fear she has had to endure and he vows to make things right.\r\n\r\nBarbara recruits a new accomplice, Damian, to make Fernanda fall in love and marry him. Assuming the name Franco Santoro, Eduardo gets involved with Gonzalo\u2019s company with the intention of unmasking all the people responsible for his suffering and making them pay. Fernanda finds herself strongly and inexplicably attracted to this newcomer, and soon the love that had never really died is rekindled.\r\n\r\nBefore her passing, Soledad gives Liliana a small chest where she keeps the secret of her misfortunes, in the hope that she will one day free herself of the grievous injustice that has ruined her life. Not long after, and with Eduardo\u2019s help, Liliana denounces Barbara to the police.\r\n\r\nBarbara rids herself of Artemio, but in the process his big secret is uncovered: that he is Gonzalo\u2019s half brother and that he was bent on destroying him utterly. Damian and Barbara turn on each other. The black cloud that hung over the Elizalde family is finally lifted, and nothing will stand in the way of Eduardo and Fernanda\u2019s happiness, for they now know that the strongest force of all is true love itself.\r\n\r\nToday may be impossible but\u2026 Tomorrow is Forever!", "seriesName": "Tomorrow is Forever", "slug": "tomorrow-is-forever", "status": "Ended"}, {"aliases": [], "banner": "blank/335434.jpg", "firstAired": "", "id": 335434, "network": "", "overview": null, "seriesName": "Minecraft: Forever Stranded", "slug": "minecraft-forever-stranded", "status": ""}, {"aliases": [], "banner": "", "firstAired": "2017-09-11", "id": 335995, "network": "", "overview": "The Promise of Forever is a 2017 Philippine romantic fantasy drama television series starring Paulo Avelino, Ritz Azul and Ejay Falcon.

Using the song as narrative, we choose Christmas recipes each of which follows on to the next, with a great use of left-overs from the previous recipe.  Everybody's made turkey fricasse \u2013 we show you how to make a proper, really tasty goose risotto \u2013 but you can use left-over turkey instead.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boys cook a partridge and pear dish in the town centre of Norwich and go in search of the real Alan Partridge (Aha), seemingly based on a disc jockey at the local radio station.  They cook in the medieval city centre, steeped in atmosphere, peppered with unique architectural treasures and with a wide range of delicious local, seasonal food.  The Hairies cook roast partridge with a chestnut and apricot stuffing, fondant potatoes and pickled pears \u2013 inspired by a meeting in a car park with the Godfather himself, Antonio Carluccio.   Then, back at the cottage, the boys turn the left-overs into a simple supper of delicious samosas for their loved ones.     \r\n\r\nNext they cook three of the world's best chickens, Poulets de Bresse, for four Newcastle call centre workers, rustling up chicken breasts with a citrus crust, and thighs stuffed with parsley, thyme and lemon. They then concoct a chicken noodle soup from the carcasses and drumsticks \u2013 nothing goes to waste. Then they head off to the Aquatic Centre, one of of the London 2012 Olympic Stadium sites, and cook a breakfast buffet of five jumbo pretzels for the builders, served with corned beef hash and poached eggs. Mother Goose is one of the classic Christmas pantomimes.  Si and Dave go to the Chipping Norton \r\nTheatre to visit their flamboyant friend David Marcus, a famous pantomime dame from Barrow.  He teaches the retiring duo the art of becoming perfect pantomime  dames.  In return, they cook him and his crew a classic roast goose Christmas dinner. \r\n\r\nNext, the Hairy Bikers visit the Severn Swans brewery in Gloucestershire where they cook a goose risotto with green peppercorns washed down with the local beer. They visit the family-run Jess's Ladies Organic Dairy Farm in Gloucestershire with its herd of eighty cows, each individually named and lovingly looked after \u201cbecause happy, healthy cows make better milk.\u201d  For eight milkmaids, the boys cook up a classic Christmas pudding with a twist \u2013 a rum and raisin Christmas panacotta.  'This will become a family favourite \u2013 light, sexy, spicy and modern \u2013 a little like ourselves!'  Si and Dave visit The Lord of the Dance at the Sunderland Empire \u2013 still thrilling audiences around the world for more than a decade - and join the performers on stage.  Their recipe is an Irish-inspired stew fortified with Christmas ale.\r\n\r\nFinally they go to a manor house in the depths of the Scottish countryside where they are joined by bagpipers and drummers to cook 'flashmob style' for the team putting the final touches to the Christmas tree.  The show culminates with a 'Perfect Day' style rendition of THE TWELVE DAYS OF CHRISTMAS performed by all the contributors the boys have met on their journey. Si says: \u201cOur recipes are delicious alternatives to the Christmas norm.  It is also very important, especially in this day and age, that nothing is wasted.  We show three ways with chicken, how the leftovers can become a delicious stock which goes into a fantastic goose risotto \u2013 each recipe leads through to the next. It's been a real challenge putting the show together and Dave and I have enjoyed ourselves immensely.\u201d\r\n\r\nDave concludes: \u201cOur Christmas Special has something for everyone: entertainment, lunacy, pantomime dames, lords of the dance and really good recipes.  Viewers can substitute ingredients, and by the end of the hour they will have a dozen useful recipes.  It has certainly been one of the most enjoyable shows that Si and I have worked on!\u201d", "seriesName": "The Hairy Bikers Celebrate the Twelve Days of Christmas", "slug": "the-hairy-bikers-celebrate-the-twelve-days-of-christmas", "status": "Ended"}, {"aliases": [], "banner": "", "firstAired": "2009-09-09", "id": 113271, "network": "BBC Two", "overview": "On 12 September 2008 the heads of Wall Street's three biggest investment banks are summoned to a late afternoon meeting at the New York Federal Reserve.

Each episode is narrated by a \"body\" who watches the team as they pursue the tantalizingly difficult challenge of figuring out who this victim once was. Why would anyone volunteer for such a grim task? As new recruit Tyler Davies quickly discovers, each of the members of the team has his or her own reasons for volunteering for the Network. Alex Donovan is a former cop, whose 11-year-old daughter was kidnapped and has never been found. Linda Manning, the woman who runs the network from her home, is a virtual recluse whose husband is a convicted murderer. Walter Bailey does stake outs - when he's not blowing his cover. Candace Butler hates her day job. She also happens to have a special gift for putting people at ease - even the prickly Tyler, a talented sculptor with a background in forensics. Follow these committed amateur investigators as they race against time to piece together the stories of these dead people's lives - and ultimately, hopefully, their murders.", "seriesName": "The Forgotten", "slug": "the-forgotten", "status": "Ended"}, {"aliases": [], "banner": "", "firstAired": "1999-02-15", "id": 197381, "network": "ITV", "overview": "Ben Turner is a happily married man in his late thirties who owns a used book shop and helps his wife run an inn in a small town in England.

Of this close-knit group of friends, everyone else has paired off, while Brian has emerged as the last bachelor standing. At 34, regardless of his run of bad luck in matters of the heart, Brian still holds out hope that one day he'll open the door and be blinded by love. However questions about his fate have been popping up more frequently in his head. The most pressing question is - and it's one that only he can answer -- could all of his problems stem from the fact that he is harboring a crush on the picture-perfect Marjorie, his best friend's girl? Adam, Brian's best friend since childhood, was going to break up with Marjorie but found himself proposing to her instead. He's a lawyer and Marjorie is a pediatric surgeon. Their busy lifestyles leave them little time to plan their upcoming wedding and, oddly enough, that seems to have given them more time to re-evaluate whether they're indeed doing the right thing. Brian's fortysomething sister, Nic, and her boy-toy husband, Angelo, are trying hard to start a family, but something's not right. Nic's high-stress work as a record executive and Angelo's fledgling acting career have created some anxiety in the new marriage. Now they're torn between conceiving a child the old-fashioned way or using modern medicine to speed up the process. Dave, who runs a video game business with Brian called Zap Monkey, is married to stay-at-home mom Deena. They've been together for 13 years, have three little girls and a lackluster sex life.

They'd no idea where they'd been taken, and were deliberately deposited in as desolate, inhospitable and lonely environment as possible. They then had to get back to London as quickly as possible, and the first team home won a bottle of champagne - plus the chance to do it all again next week.\r\n\r\nVarious elements combined to make the participants' respective journeys hugely enjoyable television. There was our sometimes gruesomely intimate insight into the relationships between team members, as they worked with but often against each other and squabbled constantly over how to make progress. The isolation aspect was intensely tangible. Aside from just one solitary cameraman - who themselves often became part of the drama - each pair were utterly alone, and you really felt it. Then there was the fact it was a desperately tense race against time. For every nonchalant easy-going contestant there was another absolutely determined to win at all costs. Finally Lost showcased a hilariously haphazard style of globetrotting, involving chaotic hitching and hiking across whole continents to the utter bemusement of their inhabitants.

In these brief but tumultuous years following the Civil War, men and women endured astonishing hardship and danger, from battles with Indians and outlaws, to nature\u2019s own brutalities. Yet for a few extraordinary individuals, it was a time of incredible opportunity. Cowboys drove millions of steers from Texas along cattle trails to northern railroad heads. Their daring but solitary journeys established cowboys as heroes whose strength and character made them the ultimate icons of their time. But the hazardous frontier, where the law often amounted to little mor than a man with a badge and a posse, also bred some of America\u2019s most infamous outlaws, whose reputations still inspire awe.

Nancy is a fun-loving, intelligent perfectionist with a good heart. Since she is very much in love with John and quite the opposite of him, her conservative Upper East Side upbringing balances her relationship with her no-rules boyfriend.

The central story revolves around Mary (Angela Harding), a young domestic who comes to work for the wealthy, oblivious Bradshaws (Edward Byrne and Daphne Carroll). Once Mary meets handsome, kind foundry worker \"Fitz\" Fitzpatrick (Bryan Murray), she immediately falls in love, and the couple make plans to save enough money to eventually marry. \r\n\r\nMary, distressed at the way the Bradshaws shuttle off their devoted housekeeper Miss Gilchrist (Mairin D. O'Sullivan) to the poor house when she can no longer work, decides to leave the insensitive Bradshaw household and marry Fitz.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, historic events conspire to make the young couple's life one of continued want and anxiety.
