Because of this, some networks air the show five days per week, thus covering all but a half hour of the three-hour E/I mandate.", "origin_country": ["US"]}, {"original_name": "Jack Hanna's Into the Wild", "id": 31822, "name": "Jack Hanna's Into the Wild", "vote_count": 0, "vote_average": 0, "poster_path": null, "first_air_date": "", "popularity": 0.6, "genre_ids": [99], "original_language": "en", "backdrop_path": "/937q40pPIlqkLXATRpDDaZcj5Mg.jpg", "overview": "Jack Hanna's Into the Wild is a reality television series about all different kinds of animals in their natural habitat.

A spokesman for Jeter's employer, the New York Yankees, objected to the ad, saying \"In the ad they insinuate they are out with Jeter, with his permission, or they are following him. Give me a break. Neither is true.\" ESPN realized that the show would be risky; if sports figures were angered by their coverage on ESPN Hollywood they might refuse to participate in interviews on other ESPN programs. The final episode was broadcast on January 26, 2006.

Zorro Productions, Inc. had licensed the rights to Cool Comics, but cancelled it after a whole year of development by Cool Comics, wanting to do justice to the property rather than hurriedly produce a cheap product, with the reason being that they had 'forgotten' about their licensing arrangement with Cool Comics, and that Sony had approached them with a desire to do a series with a similar theme. The programming deal and concept for the new series was developed by Ungar, G7 and Pangea and underwritten partially by a master toy license with Brazilian toy company, Gulliver Toys. Writers at Cool Comics, Neil Southwell and Hans Christian Vang, despite having worked on their comic book and art for over a year, were told they would not able to release the material, due to the similar subject matter suddenly appearing from out of nowhere, after their scripts had been continuously approved by Zorro Productions. What made the Ungar-BKN show unique were the plethora of high tech gadgets, also present in Cool Comics' series, and the conceit of having the young Zorro ride his motorcycle named after his horse, Tornado, also originally present in the Cool Comics comic book scripts. The show has been aired in the UK on POP! on 7 April 2008 and was shown on Kix! on 19 May 2008.

Asit, the older brother of the family and his wife, Lalita took over the family\u2019s construction business. Orncha, the second sister took care of everything in the household. Arnus, the youngest sister studied in England but because of the changes in her financial state Nus has to find a benefactor to finance her education \u2013 she received aid from Pa, an old man named Chart from Thailand. Chart felt a familiar connection with Nus who reminded him of his daughter whom life was cut short by a car accident. She too was named Nus.\n\nSubsequently, the Vichawayt\u2019s contruction company will be hired by a young millionaire magnate named Krao Supagan who offered the company a contract to build a grand hotel costing several hundreds millions bahts. Arnus came back to Thailand with her best friend, Gonwik and met Krao who went to pick Wik up at the airport for the first time. Because Krao and Wik have feeling for one another it was not surprising that Krao and Nus were to meet each other often at Wik\u2019s house. (Krao is actually Wik\u2019s distance relative whom she is secretly in love with. She called him Uncle Krao.) Nus saw Krao as an enigma, a strange person but she missed him when he\u2019s not around. Nus\u2019s feeling for Chaithong, her boyfriend changed for when he offered her marriage Nus refused and declared she\u2019s not ready yet.\n\nThen Chart fell sick \u2013 it was revealed to Nus that her Pa is actually Krao\u2019s uncle. Arnus accepted to be Chart\u2019s caretaker which went according to Krao\u2019s plan. Krao then continued on with his scheme by going after Orncha and Lalita, every woman of the Vichawayt will be under his wrath.\n\nThe situation got worst for the Vichawayt when debt collectors came after their family home, if they didn\u2019t pay up their house will get seize. Krao helped the family by giving them 20 million baht to borrow but because the money was his the house became his property.\n\nThen Asit got into an accident giving Krao the opportunity to get close to his wife. Krao had an affair with Lalita and the two were seem by Chaithong who brought the news to Arnus. Arnus hated Krao and was disappointed by the conduct of the two.\n\nAs for Orncha, Krao brought her stuffs and flirted heavily with her. He told her to break up with Pharop, her lover. Orn believed him and broke up with her boyfriend. Once Arnus found out about the break up she told Krao to stop his involvements with her sister and sister-in-law. Krao then offered her marriage as a solution which she agreed because she felt sorry for her brother and wanted to help her sister who used to say she hated Krao but has now fallen in love with him. Both Lalita and Orncha were sadden and upset by this news. Orn quietly married Pharop as a result of her grief over Krao. As for Wik, she was very hurt by her best friend\u2019s wedding to Krao that she went to live in America with her family.\n\nKrao gave Nus a one year contract in the marriage before he can divorce her, a promise he made to his uncle who knew why he wanted to marry her. On their wedding night Krao proceeded with his plan and raped Nus to be his wife. He also told her his reason for doing so \u2013 he revealed to her that the Vichawayt family deserved all of this because his mom was raped by her dad. Nus\u2019s dad raped a woman despite knowing that she already has a son and husband and that husband was none other than his old friend, the man that helped him to richness with his business. His mother was hurt \u2013 being overwhelmed with shame she committed suicide.\n\nLalita still have feeling for Krao, after she divorced her husband she tried to seduce Krao but he got angry with her. He found her repulsive. He scolded her harshly and asked her if she still remember Chewit or not, the guy who got his heart broken by her and committed suicide as a result of that heartache. Chewit was Krao\u2019s younger brother, everything Krao did to Lalita was out of revenge not love. Krao told Lalita that she\u2019s nothing to him but a cheap woman. Furious and hurt by his words Lalita took out a gun to shoot Krao but Nus took the bullet for him instead landing her in a critical condition in the hospital.\n\nTimes passed by, Orn gave birth to her first child with Pharop, Asit went to America to gain work experience, Lalita was sentenced to jail time for her crime, and Anus made a complete recovery from being shot.

Local ne'er-do-wells, bumbling pals, and temperamental girlfriends further complicate his life. Andy Griffith stated in a Today Show interview, with respect to the time period of the show: \"Well, though we never said it, and though it was shot in the '60s, it had a feeling of the '30s. It was when we were doing it, of a time gone by.\"\n\nThe series never placed lower than seventh in the Nielsen ratings and ended its final season at number one. It has been ranked by TV Guide as the 9th-best show in American television history. Though neither Griffith nor the show won awards during its eight-season run, series co-stars Knotts and Bavier accumulated a combined total of six Emmy Awards. The show, a semi-spin-off from an episode of The Danny Thomas Show titled \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\", spawned its own spin-off series, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., a sequel series, Mayberry R.F.D., and a reunion telemovie, Return to Mayberry.

The team investigate the phenomena, trying to determine if the stones of the building are acting as a recording medium for past events. However, their investigations serve only to unleash a darker, more malevolent force.\n\nThe Stone Tape was written by Nigel Kneale, best known as the writer of Quatermass. Its juxtaposition of science and superstition is a frequent theme in Kneale's work; in particular, his 1952 radio play You Must Listen, about a haunted telephone line, is a notable antecedent of The Stone Tape. The play was also inspired by a visit Kneale had paid to the BBC's research and development department, which is located in an old Victorian house in Kingswood, Surrey. Critically acclaimed at time of broadcast, it remains well regarded to this day as one of Nigel Kneale's best and most terrifying plays.

A surreal series devised by Anthony Newley, who also starred, it was written by Dick Hills and Sid Green. Unusually for a comedy show, the series was shot entirely on 35mm film; the first three episodes were shot on location, while the rest of the series was studio-bound. The series follows the character of Gurney Slade, played by Newley, through a series of mundane environments with fantastical elements. The first episode opens with Slade breaking the fourth wall of a traditional television sitcom and leaving the set, to the protestations of its director.\n\nThe name Gurney Slade is taken from the name of a district in the Mendip Hills in Somerset, England, not far from the city of Wells. Having recently passed through the area, Newley remembered the name at an early meeting, after a number of proposed titles \u2013 including Up the Zambezi \u2013 were rejected. The series was produced by Alan Tarrant, who directed the series with Newley.\n\nNewley explained at the time: \"There is no rhyme or reason for what I do, I merely take life and turn it upside down. We hope to achieve humour without setting out to be deliberately funny.\" A reputed influence on the early career of David Bowie, the surrealism of the series was considerably ahead of its time for a 1960 television comedy and it soon proved insufficiently popular with the mainstream audience, resulting in it being moved from primetime to a late-night 'graveyard' timeslot by ITV.

The earlier seasons in particular featured several multi-part episodes, serious topics, and dramatic moments. As in other Lear shows of the era, the show was shot on videotape in front of a live audience, giving it a sense of immediacy, and close-ups were often employed during dramatic scenes. As the social climate changed in the 1980s, the show's writing became less edgy, and as the girls became adults, the innovation of the original premise \u2014 a divorced mother raising teenage children \u2014 was lost.

For this reason, the initial 60 minutes following a traumatic incident is often called the critical hour in emergency medicine parlance. It is more commonly known as the \"Golden Hour Concept\".\n\nThe show first aired in 2003. Early episodes of the series took place in Columbus, Ohio, New Orleans, Louisiana, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, among other places. A new set of episodes was shot in 2004 and 2005, centered around two cities and three trauma centers: Baltimore, Maryland and Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The former shows were a decidedly different format, with a running timeclock on the patients as they made their way through the initial entrance into the trauma system, while the latter episodes tend to transition between patients' stories, following a smaller set of patient stories from beginning to end throughout the episode. A standalone show, Chopper Rescue, a documentary about flight paramedics in Los Angeles, California, was added to the rotation under the \"Critical Hour\" umbrella title in 2005. Production continued on the show in 2006, this time centered exclusively on the two Toronto-area hospitals, though the Baltimore Shock Trauma episodes continue to air in reruns periodically.", "origin_country": ["US"]}, {"original_name": "The Critical List", "id": 26248, "name": "The Critical List", "vote_count": 0, "vote_average": 0, "poster_path": null, "first_air_date": "", "popularity": 0.6, "genre_ids": [], "original_language": "en", "backdrop_path": null, "overview": "", "origin_country": ["US"]}]}, "The Flintstones": {"page": 1, "total_results": 2, "total_pages": 1, "results": [{"original_name": "The Flintstones", "id": 1996, "name": "The Flintstones", "vote_count": 191, "vote_average": 7.13, "poster_path": "/ktzefGtGUwMGAmN1Bna1oTeLSnX.jpg", "first_air_date": "1960-09-30", "popularity": 18.217, "genre_ids": [10751, 16, 35], "original_language": "en", "backdrop_path": "/3PBOuuviWEcQOTXZc5WwC9GjYNY.jpg", "overview": "The misadventures of two modern-day Stone Age families, the Flintstones and the Rubbles.", "origin_country": ["US"]}, {"original_name": "The Flintstones' 25th Anniversary Celebration", "id": 8116, "name": "The Flintstones' 25th Anniversary Celebration", "vote_count": 0, "vote_average": 0, "poster_path": null, "first_air_date": "", "popularity": 0.6, "genre_ids": [16], "original_language": "en", "backdrop_path": null, "overview": "The Flintstones' 25th Anniversary Celebration was a 60-minute CBS live-action and animated television special produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions in association with Robert Guenette Productions commemorating the 25th anniversary of television's first primetime animated series, The Flintstones, which was broadcast on May 20, 1986.

If both combat robots are still operational at the end of the match the winner is determined by a point system based on damage, aggression, and strategy.\n\nThe television show BattleBots aired on the American cable network Comedy Central for five seasons, covering five BattleBots tournaments. The first season aired starting in August 2000, and the fifth season aired starting in August 2002. Hosts of BattleBots were Bil Dwyer and Sean Salisbury and correspondents included former Baywatch actresses Donna D'Errico, Carmen Electra, and Traci Bingham, former Playboy Playmate Heidi Mark, and identical twins Randy and Jason Sklar. Bill Nye was the show's \"technical expert\".\n\nAfter five 'seasons', Comedy Central terminated their contract with BattleBots Inc. in late 2002.", "origin_country": ["US"]}]}, "Beyond the Tank": {"page": 1, "total_results": 1, "total_pages": 1, "results": [{"original_name": "Beyond the Tank", "id": 62527, "name": "Beyond the Tank", "vote_count": 3, "vote_average": 6.67, "poster_path": "/fTNJ6U9LwJi3odXUY23CiNpaAII.jpg", "first_air_date": "2015-05-01", "popularity": 0.768, "genre_ids": [10764], "original_language": "en", "backdrop_path": "/s68lZxLsfkmuXfCTlHVQUhGUVGm.jpg", "overview": "\u201cBeyond the Tank\u201d is a one-hour companion series from the producers of the Emmy-winning reality series, \u201cShark Tank.\u201d Audiences familiar with the compelling ups and downs of the negotiations will be further engaged in the drama that takes place after the entrepreneurs\u2019 appearance on \u201cShark Tank.\u201d What lies in the aftermath of their investment?

The focus of the expedition is to investigate the status of the tiger in Bhutan, where little is known of the cat's distribution or population density. Evidence of a healthy population of tigers would elevate Bhutan's importance as a sanctuary for this endangered species. It would also support tiger conservationist Dr. Alan Rabinowitz's proposal for a vast protected corridor linking the fragmented pockets of tiger habitat which lie to the south of the Himalayas.\n\nThe expedition is notable for obtaining the first footage of tigers living at 4,000 metres in the high Himalayas. The BBC footage shows a female tiger lactating and scent-marking, followed a few days later by a male tiger responding, suggesting that the cats could be breeding at this altitude. Previously, anecdotal sightings from Bhutanese mountain villagers suggested tigers were capable of visiting such heights, but it was not known whether they were living and breeding there. The footage was obtained using remote camera traps which are triggered by motion. This discovery dramatically increases the known range of viable tiger habitat.

In 1963, when another major star, Judy Garland was signed to a weekly television variety series, it failed to catch on with the public. One of the main reasons for its demise was its constant change of format and the fact that critics and audiences felt that Garland was not shown off to her best advantage. In order to avoid that error, Andrews asked producer Nick Vanoff what the premise of the show would be about. Vanoff immediately answered her by saying \"Julie Andrews...without Julie Andrews there is no 'Julie Andrews Hour'\".\n\nThe show premiered on ABC Wednesday, September 13, 1972 at 10:00 P.M. ET to rave reviews. Unfortunately, its time slot proved to be daunting because it was up against the popular CBS detective series, Cannon. Another reason for the low ratings was that the lateness of the hour was not conducive to family viewing since children were in bed by that time. On Thanksgiving Eve, November 22, 1972, \"The Julie Andrews Hour\" devoted an entire episode saluting Walt Disney. To make it more of a \"family special\", ABC switched the time slot of \"The Julie Andrews Hour\" that night to 8:30 P.M. and The ABC Wednesday Movie Of The Week to 9:30 P.M. The ratings improved a little so ABC then made a decision to alternate Andrews' time period each week This continued until January, 1973 when the series was moved to Saturday nights at 9:00 P.M.

Out of the original six participants, four of them left the show and were replaced by other willing students, chosen by a public telephone vote. Although the series was groundbreaking, The Living Soap attracted the wrong kind of controversy and was taken off the air after about five months, though filming continued. The remaining housemates appeared in two one-hour specials later on in 1994.\n\nThe Living Soap differs from most of today's reality shows because, to achieve the sense of currency suggested by the show's name, each episode was aired as soon as it was made. Therefore, the depiction of everyday life was inevitably distorted from episode two onwards by the fact that the subjects were on television every week.\n\nThe programme's subjects complained about the way they were portrayed due to the editing carried out by the show's producers and directors, which included Spencer Campbell. In an episode of the 2008 Channel 4 documentary series How TV Changed Britain, former housemate Colin Rothbart explained that he took part in the show not to be famous, but for \"a laugh\" and to use as a stepping stone into a career in television. Also interviewed was Spencer Campbell, who claimed to have developed the concept of a \"diary room\", in which reality television participants talk privately to a camera.", "origin_country": ["GB"]}, {"original_name": "Echo Beach UK Soap", "id": 14333, "name": "Echo Beach UK Soap", "vote_count": 0, "vote_average": 0, "poster_path": null, "first_air_date": "", "popularity": 0.6, "genre_ids": [], "original_language": "en", "backdrop_path": null, "overview": "", "origin_country": ["GB"]}, {"original_name": "Soap on the range", "id": 14760, "name": "Soap on the range", "vote_count": 0, "vote_average": 0, "poster_path": null, "first_air_date": "", "popularity": 0.6, "genre_ids": [], "original_language": "en", "backdrop_path": null, "overview": "", "origin_country": ["US"]}, {"original_name": "CBS Soap Break", "id": 45690, "name": "CBS Soap Break", "vote_count": 0, "vote_average": 0, "poster_path": null, "first_air_date": "", "popularity": 0.6, "genre_ids": [], "original_language": "en", "backdrop_path": null, "overview": "", "origin_country": ["US"]}, {"original_name": "No. 1 Soap Fan", "id": 15772, "name": "No. 1 Soap Fan", "vote_count": 0, "vote_average": 0, "poster_path": null, "first_air_date": "", "popularity": 0.6, "genre_ids": [], "original_language": "en", "backdrop_path": null, "overview": "No. 1 Soap Fan was a one-off gameshow hosted by Bradley Walsh for ITV on 29 December 2007.

Often, the cast would appear as themselves and address the audience to promote fake contests or to deliver mock public service announcements. Much like Monty Python, The State's sketches were sometimes linked to each other in some way: a punchline or image that ended one sketch often provided a lead-in to the next.\n\nAfter years of legal issues related to the soundtrack to many of the episodes, the series was released on DVD on July 14, 2009.

Dark Shadows also featured werewolves, zombies, man-made monsters, witches, warlocks, time travel, and a parallel universe.

Major writers besides Art Wallace included Malcolm Marmorstein, Sam Hall, Gordon Russell, and Violet Welles.\n\nDark Shadows was distinguished by its vividly melodramatic performances, atmospheric interiors, memorable storylines, numerous dramatic plot twists, unusually adventurous music score, and broad and epic cosmos of characters and heroic adventures. Now regarded as something of a classic, it continues to enjoy an intense cult following.

The show's producers coordinate with a local construction contractor, which then coordinates with various companies in the building trades for a makeover of the family's home. This includes interior, exterior and landscaping, performed in seven days while the family is on vacation and documented in the episode. If the house is beyond repair, they replace it entirely.

One critic at the Globe and Mail described it as \"execrably written and acted\" while another strained to find positive elements, \"At times, there is a plodding workmanlike quality to Shattered City.\" The miniseries won some technical awards at the Canadian television Gemini Awards in 2004 but was passed over for any direction or writing awards and won only a single supporting acting award for Ted Dykstra.", "origin_country": []}, {"original_name": "James Ellroy's LA: City Of Demons", "id": 38385, "name": "James Ellroy's LA: City Of Demons", "vote_count": 0, "vote_average": 0, "poster_path": null, "first_air_date": "2011-01-19", "popularity": 0.6, "genre_ids": [], "original_language": "en", "backdrop_path": null, "overview": "", "origin_country": ["US"]}, {"original_name": "Rome: A History Of The Eternal City", "id": 54522, "name": "Rome: A History Of The Eternal City", "vote_count": 0, "vote_average": 0, "poster_path": null, "first_air_date": "2012-12-05", "popularity": 0.6, "genre_ids": [99], "original_language": "en", "backdrop_path": null, "overview": "Author and historian Simon Sebag Montefiore presents a three-part series uncovering the central role played by religion in creating and maintaining the power of the city of Rome.", "origin_country": []}, {"original_name": "Ring of Power - The Empire of the City", "id": 52425, "name": "Ring of Power - The Empire of the City", "vote_count": 0, "vote_average": 0, "poster_path": null, "first_air_date": "", "popularity": 0.6, "genre_ids": [99], "original_language": "en", "backdrop_path": null, "overview": "", "origin_country": []}, {"original_name": "Space Precinct", "id": 3129, "name": "Space Precinct", "vote_count": 5, "vote_average": 6.2, "poster_path": "/miR5T2JNCRkFIVl9LaGlacz8nN0.jpg", "first_air_date": "1994-10-03", "popularity": 1.955, "genre_ids": [10765, 18], "original_language": "en", "backdrop_path": "/9iOGN0EZXRqVED3BvlL8YRziKRx.jpg", "overview": "Space Precinct is a British television series that aired from 1994 to 1995 on Sky One and later on BBC Two in Britain, and in first-run syndication in the US.
